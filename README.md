# Basic Python Learning

A collection of simple and practical Python projects demonstrating core programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and user input.

## Overview
This repository contains basic Python scripts created as part of my learning journey. Each script demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, user input, if, elif, else, etc..

## Projects
- `the_cyclone.py`: Ride eligibility checker based on height and credits.
- `magic8ball.py`: A simple Magic 8 Ball simulator.
- `currencyconverter.py`: Currency conversion tool to usd.
- `phlevels.py`: using user input to determine the state of pH level
- `pythagoreantheorem.py`: using user input for triangle side length and using that for basic math functions
- `bmi.py`: using set variables to use exponent math to calculate body mass index
